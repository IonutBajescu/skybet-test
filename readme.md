# Environment
The application was developed under the Homestead vagrant machine and it has been tested only with Chrome 46, OS X.

# Serialisation
I know that in the requirements it was said to use the php serialisation, however, I chose JSON for portability reasons.

# End note
The Big Bang Theory is really nice.
